# Getting Started
A Guide for the Very Beginner

## Introduction
This project makes use of two main tools:

1. QGIS
1. GitHub

While the creators of this project assume contributors have a good understanding of the concepts of GIS, they don't necessarily expect that you have experience with QGIS.  The same is generally true of GitHub - you should have basic data management skills, but maybe you haven't worked with GitHub yet.  For people new to the version control concept, we'll recommend you start with GitHub Desktop, but if you're already using another tool, feel free to use what works for you.  If you're already a pro with both version control & QGIS, great!  If not, we have some suggestions for how to get started and where to learn the skills you'll need.

## Tasks Before You Get Started:
1. If you don't already have one, __set up your GitHub Account__:  https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/ 
   * We recommend you use a professional string for your user name that your colleagues will be able to use to easily idenfity you.
