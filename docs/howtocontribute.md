# How to Contribute
As is a living project, the AVAs Digitizing Project's list of tasks are constantly changing. We track needed tasks on the [Issues list](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/ava/issues) on our GitHub Repository. The most common tasks we need help with are digitizing new boundaries, revisions to existing boundaries, and quality control of the boundaries we've finished. Occasionally, there are also programming and documentation tasks. Prospective contributors should review the open issues to see if there are any tasks they would like to take on. [Contact us](https://ucdavislibrary.github.io/ava/contact.html) or post a comment on an issue to introduce yourself and ask any questions. Our [Methods Documentation](https://ucdavislibrary.github.io/ava/methods.html) explains our workflow and how to perform common tasks like digitizing.
