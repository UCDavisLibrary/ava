# Visualizations
The plot below is an example using the data from the AVA project to visualize the number of AVAs divided by states. Only states with more than 5 AVAs were selected, while those with less were summed to crerate "Others Summed".

This plot is another example of the number of AVAs per state, adding all of the AVAs from states other than California ("Others Summed") and comparing them to California by itself.
