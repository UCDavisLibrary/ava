<p>As is a living project, the AVAs Digitizing Projectâ€™s list of tasks are constantly changing. We track needed tasks on the <a href="https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/ava/issues">Issues list</a> on our GitHub Repository. The most common tasks we need help with are digitizing new boundaries, revisions to existing boundaries, and quality control of the boundaries weâ€™ve finished. Occasionally, there are also programming and documentation tasks. Prospective contributors should review the open issues to see if there are any tasks they would like to take on. <a href="https://ucdavislibrary.github.io/ava/contact.html">Contact us</a> or post a comment on an issue to introduce yourself and ask any questions. Our <a href="https://ucdavislibrary.github.io/ava/methods.html">Methods Documentation</a> explains our workflow and how to perform common tasks like digitizing.</p>
