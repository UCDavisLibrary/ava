# American Viticultural Areas (AVA) Project

The UC Davis library, in conjunction with UCSB, Virginia Tech, other partner organizations, and contributions from the general public, will create a publicly accessible version American Viticultural Areas boundaries.  Using the text descriptions from the ATPF Code of regulations, we will build this data from the official descriptions.  These data will be made freely available.  This dataset will provide wine researchers with an important tool as they examine the scientific, economic and historical aspects of viticulture.

Anyone can contribute to this project.

# Project Rationale
All wine sold is marked by a geographic location specifying where the grapes that make the wine were grown. Sometimes these geographical markers, or appellations, are shaped by political boundaries, but more often or not a wine’s geography is marked by a designated grape-grown region. In the United States, grape-growing regions are called American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) and their boundaries are established by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) under the Department of the Treasury. Today, there are 142 AVAs in California, for example, each recognized for its distinctive topographical, climatic, and/or historic and cultural features. Some are as well-known as the Napa Valley AVA established in 1981, and others as new the Malibu Coast AVA established in 2014.  

These designations are extremely important to the development of both the wine industry and wine research. They provide the standard geographical category for those seeking to evaluate and compare wine aesthetics, wine production and marketing data, and the science related to different wine-growing environments. 

While the AVAs are widely used in industry and research, there is no freely available, open-access geographical information dataset demarcating the boundaries of these regions in California (or in other States). GIS representations of the official AVA boundaries delineated in the US Code of Federal Regulations are incomplete, and those that are available are restricted and expensive to use. By developing a cooperative project aimed at making AVAs boundaries available as an open GIS dataset, we will extend to researchers and industry a tool that will allow them to better visualize, publicize, and compare their data. 

The AVA Project seeks to empower the study of wine regions and facilitate research into emerging environmental questions, while enabling greater insight into this important sector of the California’s economy and culture.

## How Can You Contribute?
Read the [GettingStarted.md](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/ava/blob/master/GettingStarted.md), [digitizing_ava_boundaries.md](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/ava/blob/master/digitizing_ava_boundaries.md), and [quality control procedure.md](/quality_control_procedure.md) files to familiarize yourself with the policies and procedures for this project.

The project will now shift to creating historical boundaries and to quality control and we welcome contributions to both of these efforts.

## Progress
As of March 20, 2020, California's boundaries are complete and have undergone our quality control procedure. We feel that the current data for California is of high quality and suitable for use in academic research, however, please submit an Issue if you find additional areas of concern in the dataset so we can address them.

All the remaining AVA boundaries outside of California have been completed, as of May 11,2020, and we are beginning quality control procedures on these data.

New AVAs that were approved by the TTB between June and October 2020 are in the process of being added to our dataset.

### UC Davis
UC Davis completed boundaries for the northern California, Arizona, and Colorado AVAs.  Issues marked with the "UC Davis" label are designated for UC Davis to work on.  They will continue adding AVAs moving east across the county.

### UC Santa Barbara
UC Santa Barbara completed boundaries for the southern California AVAs (marked with the "UC Santa Barbara" label in the Issues list) November 2017 and have subsequently contributed many boundaries in Oregon and Washigton.

### Virginia Tech
Virginia Tech plans to complete boundaries in and around Virginia.  These boundaries are marked with the "Virginia Tech" label in the Issues list.

### Additional Partnerships
University entities (departments, labs, research groups, etc.) or other organizations interested in becoming project partners should contact us.  We're happy to discuss new partnerships in building this and similar datasets!  A partnership is not necessary, however, to contribute.

*Note:* Contributors using QGIS 2.18.10 or older with GDAL 2.2.0 should fill in any blanks in their attribute table with N/A due to a known issue with how unset values are handled. A [more permanent fix](https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16812) is in the works.  Contributors using QGIS 3.0 have not experienced this issue and it is now the version we recommend.

# How can you access the data?

## Download the whole repository
You can use the green download button on the Code tab of this repository to download all of the files in this repository or you can fork this repository.  Finished states are available for download in the AVAs By State folder.

## Download just the AVAs file or individual AVA boundaries
You can download single .geojson files (including the avas.geojson file that has all of the boundaries) by:
1. On the Code tab, navigate to the file you would like to download, and click on the file name.
1. Click the Download button, which will take you to a page that displays the text of the document.
1. Right click anywhere on the page, and select "Save as..." 
1. Save the file where you would like to keep it.  You may need to remove an additional .txt extension that may get automatically added to the file name.  You file extension should be .geojson

# What is the long-term plan for this data?
Version 1.0 will be released once all of the AVAs in California are completed and proofed for quality.  The data will be offered as a fixed set of boundaries (no longer updated) here on our GitHub site but also in the UC Davis Library Digital Asset Management System.  Work will continue on additional AVA boundaries.  Definitions for additional versions will depend on partnerships and resource availability.
