# American Viticultural Areas (AVA) Project

The American Viticultural Areas (AVA) Project is an open-licensed, community-contributed spatial dataset of the American Viticultural Areas boundaries, maintained by UC Davis [DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/) and [Library](https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/), with significant contributions from UCSB Library and Virginia Tech.

Documentation, including information about our datasets and how you can contribute, is now available on our [Documentation Website](https://ucdavislibrary.github.io/ava/).  

All contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

We have archived our older documentation for reference in the [archived_documentation](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/ava/tree/master/archived_documentation) folder.
