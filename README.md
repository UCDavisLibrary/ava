# American Viticultural Areas (AVA) Project

The American Viticultural Areas (AVA) Project is an open-licensed, community-contributed spatial dataset of the American Viticultural Areas boundaries, maintained by UC Davis DataLab and Library, with significant contributions from UCSB Library and Virginia Tech.

Documentation, including information about our datasets and how you can contribute, is now available on our [Documentation Website](https://ucdavislibrary.github.io/ava/).  

We have archived our older documentation for reference in the [archived_documentation](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/ava/tree/master/archived_documentation) folder.
