From the beginning point on the Cholame map, and crossing onto the Camatta Canyon map and then the Holland Canyon map, proceed south and then southeasterly approximately 16 miles along the eastern edge of the Shandon Valley and then the San Juan Valley by following San Juan Road (also locally known in places as Shandon San Juan Road, Camatti-Shandon Road, Bitterwater Canyon Road, and then San Juan Road again), passing the San Juan Ranch (where to road is marked as unimproved), to the road&#39;s intersection with the San Luis Obispo-Kern County boundary line at the eastern boundary line of section 12, T28S/R16E, which is also concurrent with the R16E/R17E common boundary line; then (2) Proceed south along the R16E/R17E common boundary line approximately 1.3 miles, crossing onto the La Panza Ranch map, to the boundary line&#39;s intersection with an unnamed unimproved road locally known as Navajo Creek Road, immediately south of the 1,340-foot elevation line, section 13, T28S/R16E; then (3) Proceed north-northwesterly on Navajo Creek Road to the road&#39;s intersection with the southern boundary line of section 12, T28S/R16E; then (4) Proceed west along the southern boundary line of section 12, T28S/R16E, approximately 0.7 mile to the section&#39;s southwestern corner;

then (14) Proceed northerly on Shedd Canyon Road approximately 3.2 miles, crossing onto the Shandon map, to the road&#39;s intersection with the southern boundary line of section 26, T26S/R14E; then (15) Proceed west along the southern boundary line of section 26, T26S/R14E, to the boundary line&#39;s intersection with the unnamed intermittent stream located within Shedd Canyon; then (16) Proceed northerly along the unnamed intermittent stream located within Shedd Canyon approximately 1.8 miles to the stream&#39;s intersection with the western boundary line of section 23, T26S/R14E; then (17) Proceed north along the western boundary lines of sections 23 and 14, T26S/R14E, approximately 0.6 mile to the section 14 boundary line&#39;s intersection with State Route 46; then (18) Proceed northeasterly in a straight line approximately 0.95 mile to the 1,481-foot “Estrella” elevation point, section 14, T26S/R14E;
