The South Coast viticultural area is located in California. The starting point of the following boundary description is the northern intersection of the Orange County line with the Pacific Ocean (on the Long Beach map). Boundary Description.  (i) From the starting point generally northeastward, eastward, and southeastward along the Orange County line, to the intersection of that county line with the township line on the northern border of Township 7 South (in Range 6 West; on the Santa Ana map). (ii) From there eastward along that township line to its intersection with the northern boundary of the Temecula viticultural area described in §9.50; at this point, the Temecula viticultural area boundary coincides with the boundary of the Cleveland National Forest (on the Wildomar Quadrangle map). (iii) From there following the northern boundary of the Temecula viticultural area, at and near its northernmost point, generally northeastward, eastward, and southeastward until the Temecula viticultural area boundary again intersects the township line on the northern border of Township 7 South (in Range 4 West; thus all of the Temecula viticultural area is included inside of South Coast viticultural area).
