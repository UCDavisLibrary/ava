<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<p>The UC Davis library, in conjunction with UCSB, Virginia Tech, other partner organizations, and contributions from the general public, will create a publicly accessible version American Viticultural Areas boundaries. Using the text descriptions from the ATPF Code of regulations, we will build this data from the official descriptions. These data will be made freely available. This dataset will provide wine researchers with an important tool as they examine the scientific, economic and historical aspects of viticulture.</p>

<p>Anyone can contribute to this project.</p>

<h2 id="project-rationale">Project Rationale</h2>
<p>All wine sold is marked by a geographic location specifying where the grapes that make the wine were grown. Sometimes these geographical markers, or appellations, are shaped by political boundaries, but more often or not a wine’s geography is marked by a designated grape-grown region. In the United States, grape-growing regions are called American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) and their boundaries are established by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) under the Department of the Treasury. Today, there are 142 AVAs in California, for example, each recognized for its distinctive topographical, climatic, and/or historic and cultural features. Some are as well-known as the Napa Valley AVA established in 1981, and others as new the Malibu Coast AVA established in 2014.</p>

<p>These designations are extremely important to the development of both the wine industry and wine research. They provide the standard geographical category for those seeking to evaluate and compare wine aesthetics, wine production and marketing data, and the science related to different wine-growing environments.</p>

<p>While the AVAs are widely used in industry and research, there is no freely available, open-access geographical information dataset demarcating the boundaries of these regions in California (or in other States). GIS representations of the official AVA boundaries delineated in the US Code of Federal Regulations are incomplete, and those that are available are restricted and expensive to use. By developing a cooperative project aimed at making AVAs boundaries available as an open GIS dataset, we will extend to researchers and industry a tool that will allow them to better visualize, publicize, and compare their data.</p>

<p>The AVA Project seeks to empower the study of wine regions and facilitate research into emerging environmental questions, while enabling greater insight into this important sector of the California’s economy and culture.</p>
